In an increasingly digital world, keeping our online accounts secure is of paramount importance. That's why 
I've developed a Python-based Password Manager Security Analyzer to help you manage and safeguard your passwords effectively.

Key features of the Password Manager Security Analyzer include:
Certainly, let's add icons to the key features of your Password Manager Security Analyzer:

- **Secure Password Storage (🔐):** Safely store and manage your passwords in an encrypted KeePass database.

- **Website Integration (🌐):** Associate website URLs with your stored passwords for easy retrieval.

- **Password Analysis (🔍):** Check if your passwords have been compromised in data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API.

- **Password Sharing (📋):** Easily share passwords with others without revealing the actual password.

- **Password Generator (🔑):** Generate strong and random passwords with customizable settings.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Integration (📱):** Support for adding and managing 2FA codes for your accounts.

These icons can help make your key features stand out and provide a visual representation of each functionality in your Password Manager Security Analyzer.

# How-to-use

To use the Password Manager Security Analyzer, simply create a new KeePass database or use an existing one. You can 
store your passwords, retrieve them based on entry names or website URLs, analyze password security, and view all your 
stored entries in a convenient table format.

The project is open-source and available on GitHub, so you can explore the code, contribute enhancements, or customize it 
to suit your needs.

Give it a try and take control of your passwords with confidence! Let's prioritize online security together. 💪🔒💻
